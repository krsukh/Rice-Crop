Rice crop yield prediction using improved classification technique
  In this project, rice crop yield prediction is achieved using proposed ensemble bayesnet based boosting method. Rice crop yield depend on environment's parameters 
  like rainfall, minimum temperature, average temperature, maximum temperature, vapour pressure, potential evapotranspiration, cloud cover, wet day frequency.
  This research uses classification method bayesnet based adaboost. I attach here pdf file for project report.
